# Uber_Data_Cleaning-Data_Analysis_Project
This project demonstrates end-to-end data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using Jupyter Notebook and SQL Server.
ðŸ”§ Steps Performed

Data Import & Exploration

Loaded the dataset from a CSV file.

Checked shape, size, and info of the dataset to understand data structure.

Renamed columns for better readability and consistency.

Data Understanding

Identified categorical and numerical columns.

Checked for null values in both types of columns.

Data Cleaning

Dropped columns having more than 80% missing values.

Filled remaining missing values using appropriate techniques:

Mode for categorical columns.

Mean/Median for numerical columns.

Database Integration

Connected Jupyter Notebook with SQL Server.

Loaded the cleaned dataset into a SQL table for further processing.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed analysis within Jupyter Notebook to generate insights.

Used groupby, aggregations, and visualizations to summarize trends.

ðŸ“Š Key Learnings / Skills Used

Python (Pandas, Numpy) for data cleaning & preprocessing

SQL Server for data storage & querying

Exploratory Data Analysis for finding insights

Handling missing data, renaming columns, and preparing data for analysis
